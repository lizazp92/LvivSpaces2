# LvivSpaces2

An attempt to update the older version of LvivSpaces.

What I've Learnt so far, smth I am proud of:

- A better understanding of a website's structure and the necessity of helper classes (still have to work -a lot- on it)

- Implemented bootstrap classes;

- I don't spend time on margins positioning. Flexboxes are a life saver (still dont' know much);

- BEM methodology (is making easier to read the code);

- When I check other coworking websites for references and inspiration, I kind of start to roughly understand how this or that feature was done (the most basic stuff);

Smth that irritates me a lot:

- The bigger the website the more I am lost at design "unifying". I should have thought about it from the beginning. I need to work on helper classes;

- styles.css is a big mess rn. If I work for a few hours, it's fine, I can navigate it. The next day I don't remember anything. Seems like I need to add comments to every css rule.

- if I don't use smth frequantly, I completely forget about it and learn it as if I've never heard about it (ADHD is no joke).
